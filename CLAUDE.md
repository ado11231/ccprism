# CLAUDE.md — ccprism

> Standing context for any Claude Code session working on this project.

## What this project is

A **TypeScript npm CLI** for Claude Code observability. It reads the local
session logs Claude Code already writes (`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session-id>.jsonl`)
and provides two things:

1. **Metrics** — where tokens/dollars went, per session / day / project / model
2. **Transcript viewer** — any session rendered as a clean, color-coded,
   readable conversation in the terminal

One-sentence identity: *a local, offline CLI that tells you where your Claude
Code tokens went, and shows you any session as a readable transcript.*

## Hard constraints (never violate)

- **Read-only.** The tool only ever reads `~/.claude/projects/`. It never
  writes outside its own install. "Uninstall leaves zero trace" is a promise.
- **Offline.** No API calls, no network, no telemetry. Cost is derived from a
  local pricing table, not fetched.
- **Zero-config.** Flags only in v1. No config file, no state, no daemon.
- **Graceful degradation.** Unknown model IDs → report tokens, mark cost
  unknown. Unparseable JSONL lines → skip, count, surface via `doctor`.
  Never crash on log-format drift.

## Decisions already made (do not relitigate)

- **Cut: model rerouting.** No supported hook exists in Claude Code; it would
  just be a settings.json editor. Not observability. Possible v2 shape:
  analytics-driven "suggested model" *insights*, no switching.
- **Cut: LLM-powered bash explanation.** Unneeded — every Bash tool_use in the
  logs already carries a model-written `description` field. The viewer shows
  the description bold, the raw command dimmed beneath it.
- **Viewer is static terminal output** (pipeable, less-friendly), not an Ink
  TUI and not HTML. Markdown export comes in Phase 3; TUI is a distant
  maybe.
- **Cut: budgets/alerts** (needs a daemon) and **multi-tool support** (Codex
  CLI etc. — dilutes identity; revisit later, if ever).
- **TypeScript**, not Python — the Claude Code tooling ecosystem is
  npm-centric.

## Architecture (see design.md for detail)

Three internal modules, one dependency direction:

```
parser  →  cost engine  →  renderers (dashboard, transcript)
```

- `parser/` has **zero imports from the other two** — it may become a published
  library later. It walks the `parentUuid` tree from `leafUuid` to extract the
  active branch (logs are a tree, not a list — retries/branches exist).
- Pricing lives in a **single JSON data file** keyed by model ID with five
  token tiers (input / output / cache_read / cache_write_5m / cache_write_1h;
  real logs split cache writes into two differently-priced TTLs). Kept a
  single obvious file on purpose so new-model pricing updates stay trivial.

## Conventions

- Stack: TypeScript strict, `commander`, `picocolors`, `tsup`, `vitest`.
  `bin` entry so `npx` works.
- Every command supports `--json`. Respect `NO_COLOR` and pipe detection.
  `--ascii` swaps glyphs (`●◆⚡✎└` → `* > $ + \_`).
- Feature-detect italic and truecolor; default to the 16-color palette (it
  inherits the user's theme, so it works on light and dark backgrounds).
- **Every style must survive removal**: structure comes from spacing and
  glyphs; color/weight only reinforce. Output must read fine piped to a file.
- Test fixtures are **real session JSONL files** (scrubbed). Pin fixtures per
  Claude Code version; the log format drifts between releases.
